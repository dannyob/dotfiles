# My Dotfiles!

First, many, many thanks to every other dotfile repository I've ever gawped at
amazement at.

These dotfiles are managed using [GNU
Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), using a system similar to that
described by [Brandon
Invergo](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).
One minor gotcha to note is that, by default, `stow` targets the parent
directory of the stowed files. That default works if you have a "dotfiles"
directory in your home directory. I store my dotfiles a little deeper into my
directory structure, so I use a function like this instead of using the stow
command directly:

```zsh
stowdotfiles() {
    if [ "dotfiles" = $(basename $(pwd)) ]; then
        stow -vv -t ~/ $*
    else
        echo "You're not in a dotfiles directory."
    fi
}
```
